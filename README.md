## üìê Linear Algebra Summary

This section of the Jupyter Notebook covers foundational concepts in linear algebra essential for data science and machine learning. Topics include:

### 1. **Vectors and Matrices**
- Creation and manipulation of vectors and matrices using NumPy.
- Operations like addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product.

### 2. **Matrix Operations**
- Matrix multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
- Determinants and their significance in linear systems.

### 3. **Solving Linear Systems**
- Solving systems of linear equations using matrix methods.
- Applications of `np.linalg.solve()` and checking solution validity.

### 4. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
- Introduction to eigen decomposition.
- Explanation of how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

### 5. **Applications in Data Science**
- Relevance of linear algebra in machine learning algorithms.
- Visualization of vector spaces and transformations.
